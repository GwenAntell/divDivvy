</h2>
<p>The <code>divvy</code> package implements circular subsampling with
the <code><a href="../reference/cookies.html">cookies()</a></code> function, so-named because the routine
iteratively cuts equal-area sections out of the sampled world, just as a
cookie cutter turns an irregular sheet of dough into a batch of
equivalent shapes. The method was developed in <span class="citation">Antell et al. (2020)</span>.</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="basic-procedure">Basic procedure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-procedure"></a>
</h3>
<p>The subsampling function operates on rasterised data, i.e. taxon
occurrences allocated to spatial grid cells. Within a cell, a taxon is
present or absent; the subsampling routine ignores abundance counts or
duplicate occurrences. Cells could be divided by latitude-longitude,
e.g. at 1-degree resolution, but subsampling would be fairer if the
cells have equal area regardless of latitudinal position. The Equal
Earth projection is an example of an equal-area raster system.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="cookies1.png" alt="A 5-by-5 grid, with small depictions of a bivalve and brachiopod in some squares to indicate presence points" width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>Occurrences are rasterised to presence-absence values in spatial
grid cells. Silhouettes indicate different taxa.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The procedure runs iteratively, returning a specified number of
subsamples. The process of collecting a single subsample is demonstrated
below. First, a single occupied cell is selected at random. This
starting cell is the ‘seed point’.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="cookies2.png" alt="The cell in the center of the grid, containing one clam occurrence, is highlighted." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>One occupied cell is drawn as the starting point for a new
subsample.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>To control the spatial extent of sampling, the seed cell is buffered
to a circular area of given radius. This constraint is necessary for any
type of diversity analysis because it helps standardise beta diversity,
the amount of taxonomic turnover from increasingly distant sites.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="cookies3.png" alt="A circle is overlaid on the grid, centered on the middle grid cell highlighted in the previous step. The circle covers some nearby grid cells completely and some farther cells partially." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>The seed point is buffered by a given radius (here, r = 2 cell-width
units) to constraint spatial extent of a subsample.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>From this step onward, cells are considered for the subsample only if
their centroid coordinates fall within the buffer area. Included cells
make up the pool for site rarefaction. The encompassing circle is laid
down indiscriminately with regard to geography, so the pool size will
vary with the amount of sea/land coverage in the region as well as the
amount of scientific effort to discover and collect from sites. It is
crucial to standardise the total area and number of sites because
diversity is tied to sample area through the species–area effect:
regions containing more sites will tend to return more taxa regardless
of true taxonomic richness.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="cookies4.png" alt="The radius of the circle is annotated as 2 grid cells in length. Grid cells with a center falling within the circular area are highlighted: this includes 7 of 11 occupied cells in the grid." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>Occupied cells with centroid coordinates falling inside the buffer
circle make up the pool of available subsample cells and are shaded
grey.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The final step of subsampling is selection of a given number of cells
from the available pool. If cells are equal in area, this step
standardises the total spatial area covered by the subsample. Cells are
drawn without replacement, so it is possible to obtain a subsample only
if there are at least as many occupied cells in the region as the
desired site quota. Cells are considered viable as seed points if they
lead to site pools of sufficient size; the subsampling function finds
and excludes inviable cells <em>a priori</em> to draw subsamples
efficiently from feasible regions.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="cookies5.png" alt="Of the 7 cells highlighted in the previous step (all falling mostly within the regional circle), 5 of these occupied cells are shaded to indicate their random selection for a subsample." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>A given number of cells (blue, n = 5) are drawn randomly, without
replacement from the pool of cells in the buffer circle.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>Depending on the argument specified for function output, the
procedure returns the coordinates of the subsampled cells
(<code>output = 'locs'</code>) or the data rows for occurrences
contained by those cells (<code>output = 'full'</code>). The entire
subsampling routine is repeated for a specified number of iterations. A
given cell can be selected as seed point multiple times, so it is
possible for two or more subsamples to contain identical subsets of
cells. In general, occasional duplication is inherent to random
subsampling and will be inconsequential for later analysis. However, if
the original observations are very limited in number and extent, it may
be prudent to expand the radius and/or reduce the required cell quota to
reduce the incidence of identical subsamples. To check there are a
healthy number of unique site combinations relative to the number of
replications, the analyst could compare lists of included sites between
subsamples.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="weighted-cell-selection">Weighted cell selection<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#weighted-cell-selection"></a>
</h3>
<p>The baseline method of circular subsampling described above selects
cells at random within a radial constraint. A modification to the method
selects cells probabilistically, with weight inversely proportional to
squared distance from the central seed cell. This probabilistic approach
clusters cells in the subsample more tightly while avoiding being
completely deterministic; effectively, the modification provides an
intermediate subsampling strategy between baseline circular and
nearest-neighbor subsampling. If occupied cells are sparse, cells at the
periphery of the buffer will be drawn to fill the cell quota despite
their lower selection probability. The weighted cell subsampling routine
was used to generate main-text results in Antell <em>et al.</em> (2020),
although ultimately the results from unweighted and weighted subsampling
were equivalent.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="cookies6.png" alt="Cell selection probabilities in weighted subsampling are proportional to the inverse of the squared distance from the center, colored as a heatmap in this example. The seed cell is always included in weighted subsamples." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>Cell selection probabilities in weighted subsampling are

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="nearest-neighbor-subsampling">Nearest-neighbor subsampling<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#nearest-neighbor-subsampling"></a>
</h2>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/clustr.html">clustr()</a></code> function in <code>divvy</code> subsamples
sites according to proximity, a procedure adapted from those introduced
by Close <em>et al.</em> (2017, 2020).</p>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="basic-procedure-1">Basic procedure<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#basic-procedure-1"></a>
</h3>
<p>The <code><a href="../reference/clustr.html">clustr()</a></code> function groups sites together, starting
with the closest coordinates to the starting point. As with the cookies
function, the clustering routine ignores abundance counts or duplicate
occurrences, and the process of generating a subsample begins with
random selection of an occupied site as a seed point.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="cookies2.png" alt="The same starting 5-by-5 grid of two species occurrences is shown as for the previous method. The center cell is highlighted." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>One occupied site is drawn as the starting point for a new
subsample. Here, sites are rasterised as grid cells.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>The function calculates the distance between the seed point and all
other occupied sites. The closest site is linked to the seed (the first
branch in a minimum spanning tree connecting subsample sites). The
function again (1) calculates the pairwise distances between each point
in the included set and all other occupied sites and then (2) adds the
nearest neighbor to the set. The site cluster grows deterministically
until the maximum diameter across the point set reaches a specified
limit. Below is an illustration of the minimum spanning tree connecting
all occupied sites in the example region.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="mst1.png" alt="A network of lines is drawn over the grid, with the endpoints of each line connecting two nearby, occupied grid cells. All occupied cells are touched by line ends." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>Starting from the seed cell (shaded blue), a minimum spanning tree
(solid blue lines) connects the dots of occupied sites. The maximum
diameter of this tree is 5 grid-cell units (dashed line).</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>Like the radial constraint in circular subsampling, the cap on
cluster diameter attempts to standardise beta diversity (spatial
turnover in taxa). Applying a maximum distance of 4 cell-width units
(twice the radius used in the above example for cookies), some sites are
excluded from the cluster built on this seed point.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="mst2.png" alt="The network of lines from the previous figure is pruned, such that four occupied cells at the edge of the grid are no longer linked." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>The maximum distance across the set of included sites is ~3.6;
adding any additional occupied site would increase the length above the
threshold of 4 cell-width units.</em>
</p>
</div>
<p>As with circular subsampling, the analyst should experiment with
diameter threshold values to choose a spatial bounding extent small
enough to capture regional diversity differences but large enough to
allow most sites around the world/study area to be gathered into
clusters, rather than sit outside them.</p>
<p>The function returns the final cluster coordinates (or the
occurrences located thereat, if requested), as one element in the list
output. As many subsamples are returned as specified for the number of
iterations. Due to the stochastic nature of drawing seed points and the
finite number of sites available to aggregate, it is possible for
multiple subsamples to contain identical site combinations. Site
rarefaction (described below) reduces the incidence of duplicate
clusters by further subsampling, but it is possible for the same sites
to be drawn by chance, as with circular subsampling.</p>
<p>The original versions of nearest-neighbor subsampling grouped
clusters by continental region and nested analysis within these regions
before making global comparisons <span class="citation">Close et al.
(2020)</span>. The exact method of cutting trees into continental
regions differed between the two papers, but regional assignments were
somewhat automated by looking up modern-day country codes associated
with occurrence coordinates. These approaches leave decisions for an
analyst about how to track bioregions across time and drifting tectonic
plates. The <code>divvy</code> implementation of nearest-neighbor
subsampling is more like bootstrapping, where all subsamples are treated
equivalently, irrespective of position; the full set of iterations may
be analysed in an automated and simultaneous way.</p>
</div>
<div class="section level3">
<h3 id="site-rarefaction">Site rarefaction<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#site-rarefaction"></a>
</h3>
<p>Original versions of nearest-neighbor subsampling return all sites
within a cluster that meets size and completeness specifications <span class="citation">Close et al. (2020)</span>. As noted for circular
subsampling above, however, the number of sites can vary widely between
clusters of similar extent. On average, more taxa will be observed in
clusters that include more sites/area because of the species–area
effect. Rarefaction of references or collections (defined in
Paleobiology Database data structures) is one strategy to attempt to
mitigate differences in spatial coverage within regional subsamples, but
the more direct approach is standardising the number of sites within
clusters. Site/cell rarefaction is always included under the
<code><a href="../reference/cookies.html">cookies()</a></code> function, but it is an optional choice with the
<code><a href="../reference/clustr.html">clustr()</a></code> function, since it was absent in the original
published uses. Forgoing site rarefaction increases compatibility with
how results were generated in the original published code. Implementing
site rarefaction is recommended and improves comparability between
circular and nearest-neighbor subsampling routines. In the example
below, occupied cells are drawn randomly without replacement from a full
cluster to reach a quota of 5 sites in the final subsample.</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="mst3.png" alt="The line network spans all 11 occupied sites in the grid. Five of these sites are shaded in blue; they are scattered across the grid." width="500"><p class="caption">
<em>The full cluster set (grey dots and lines, diameter = 5 units) is
rarefied to a given number of sites (blue shading, n = 5).</em>
